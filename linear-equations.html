        <article class="concept-section">
            <p>Every linear equation in two variables ($x$ and $y$) is a straight line, representing a single continuous **journey**. When you pair two such equations, you are tracking the paths of two individuals. The goal is to find if, and where, their paths overlap—a **solution** is their common ground.</p>

            <h4>The Three Destinies (The Geometric Scenarios)</h4>
            <p>When two journeys are plotted, only three possible destinies exist:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    **Intersecting Paths (Unique Solution):** The two lines cross at exactly one point. They have a single, perfect moment of meeting. This is a **consistent** system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Parallel Paths (No Solution):** The two lines run side-by-side forever, maintaining the same distance. They are mathematically destined never to meet. This is an **inconsistent** system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Coincident Paths (Infinitely Many Solutions):** The two lines are exactly the same, one tracing the path of the other. Their journeys are inseparable, and every point on the line is a moment of meeting. This is a **consistent and dependent** system.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>The Hidden Clues (Ratio Test)</h4>
            <p>You don't need to draw the graphs to predict their destiny! The ratio of their coefficients ($a_1, b_1, c_1$ for the first journey and $a_2, b_2, c_2$ for the second) tells the whole story.</p>

                <p><strong>Two General Equations:</strong> $a_1x + b_1y + c_1 = 0$ and $a_2x + b_2y + c_2 = 0$</p>
                <p>1. **Intersecting:** $\frac{a_1}{a_2} \neq \frac{b_1}{b_2}$</p>
                <p>2. **Parallel:** $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} \neq \frac{c_1}{c_2}$</p>
                <p>3. **Coincident:** $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{c_1}{c_2}$</p>

            <h4 class="concept-break">Finding the Meeting Point (The Solution Methods)</h4>
            <p>If their paths intersect, we must find the exact coordinates of their meeting. We use three high-quality techniques (methods) to achieve this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Substitution Method:** One traveler pauses to define their location in terms of the other's movement, then substitutes that knowledge into the second journey's map.</li>
                <li>**Elimination Method:** We subtly alter the scale of one or both journeys until one variable cancels out, instantly revealing the location of the other.</li>
                <li>**Cross-Multiplication Method:** A compact, elegant rule for finding the intersection point directly using the coefficients.</li>
            </ul>
