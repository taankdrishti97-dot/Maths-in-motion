            <h4>The Two Worlds</h4>
            <p>Imagine the entire number line as a vast, continuous coastline—this is the land of **Real Numbers**. But this coastline is inhabited by two distinct tribes, living in perfect harmony yet fundamentally different: **Rational** people and **Irrational** people.</p>

            <h4>The Rational Tribe (Predictable Patterns)</h4>
            <p>The Rational people are orderly. They live in houses you can easily map out—they either have a finite address (like 0.5) or their address repeats in a perfect sequence (like $0.333...$). Their core belief is: **If you know where they started and what their path is, you can always predict their location.** They can always be expressed as a simple fraction, $\frac{p}{q}$, where $q$ is not zero.</p>

            <div id="rational-formula" class="formula-box hidden">
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A number $x$ is Rational if $x = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$.</p>
                <p class="example">Example: $2$ (or $\frac{2}{1}$), $0.75$ (or $\frac{3}{4}$), $0.1\bar{6}$ (or $\frac{1}{6}$)</p>
            </div>

            <h4>The Irrational Tribe (Infinite Mystery)</h4>
            <p>The Irrational people are the mystery. Their addresses are infinite and **never repeat**. When you try to find their location (like calculating $\sqrt{2}$ or $\pi$), the digits just keep coming, revealing an endless, non-repeating pattern. They are the poets and the wanderers of the number line. They prove that some things in the universe cannot be perfectly contained within a simple ratio.</p>

                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A number is Irrational if it cannot be expressed in the form $\frac{p}{q}$ (where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$). Their decimal expansion is non-terminating and non-repeating.</p>
                <p class="example">Example: $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{3}$, $\pi$, $e$</p>

            <h4 class="concept-break">The Fundamental Rule: Revisiting Prime Factorization</h4>
            <p>The entire system relies on how numbers are built—their **Prime Factorization**. This is like the DNA of every whole number. Understanding this DNA helps us decide if a rational number will terminate (end cleanly) or repeat, based on the factors of the denominator ($q$).</p>
